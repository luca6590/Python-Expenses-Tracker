Welcome to my expense tracker project! I want to say that this is my first python project, and its very early stage.

Features:

1) Add expenses and store them in a csv file.
2) View all of your expenses directly in the app.
3) Calculate the total of all your expenses.
4) Delete any expense data that you dont need anymore directly from the app.
