Welcome to my expense tracker project! I want to say that this is my first python project, and many more features will come! This is a very early stage project, but in the future it will become bigger and with a lot other features. Also I plan to make a GUI for it, as the terminal is very sad looking.

Features:

1) Add expenses and store them in a csv file.
2) View all of your expenses directly in the app.
3) Calculate the total of all your expenses.
4) Delete any expense data that you dont need anymore directly from the app.
